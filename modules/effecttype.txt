#All effects also have a field "type"

BASE EFFECTS:
	stops_city_event_prob(event = [famine, nuke], prob = [100, 100])
	causes_per_turn_prob(event = meltdown, prob = [2])
	per_square_resource_change(criteriontype = [terrain, terraform, all], criterionval = [[road or railroad]; farm], resource = [food, shield, trade], effecttype = [+/-, %/val], effect = [int/%])
	city_resource_change(resource = [any], effecttype = [+/-, %/val], effect = [int/%])
	happiness_change(affects = [happy, unhappy], type = [+/-], effect = [int])

Special effects:
	change_trade_route_bonus(effecttype = [+/-, %/val], effect = [int/%])
	change_trade_route_val(effecttype = [+/-, %/val], effect = [int/%])
	granary(food_kept% = [50])
	unit_heal(unittype = [land, sea, air, etc.], effecttype = [+/-, %/val], effect = [int/%])
	new_veteran_mod(unittype = [land, sea, air, etc.], effecttype = [veteran], effect = [true])
	capital()
	defense_bonus(against = [land, ...], effecttype = [+/-, %/num], val = [%/num])
	bribe_cost(effecttype = [+/-, %/num], val = [%/num])
	global_warming(???)
	size_bound(bound = [1, 2])
	foreign_service_effect_mod(effecttype = [+/-, %/num], val = [%/num])

Construction restrictions:
	xor(others = [power plant types], num = 1)
	prereq(building = [...])

operation restrictions:
	max_effect_num(type = [perturn, total], num = [int])
	operation_order(order = [default == 0])

notes:
	-prob > 100 = more than once/turn. Certain once for each 100 prob, i.e. 250 prob -> 2-3 happenings/turn
	-in ordering, all same order val go together, only effects end of turn.
	-corruption/waste considered "resources", only subtracted from gross production at end of calculations. This simplifies courthouses.
